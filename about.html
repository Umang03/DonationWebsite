                    We Care Foundation helps to provide educational opportunities to disadvantaged children. These children are mostly either homeless, orphaned, abandoned, runaways, or belong to extremely poor families. Many of them have lost precious years of their childhood, working as child labour. At We Care Foundation, they are not only providing education, but also nurtured in a loving and caring environment, conducive for their holistic growth. We Care Foundation aims to reach out to the civil society – youth, individuals, institutions to come forward. We can all come together and contribute to We Care Foundation in whatever way we can – by making a donation, by spreading the word, by volunteering, or through corporate associations. We believes that every action counts!
